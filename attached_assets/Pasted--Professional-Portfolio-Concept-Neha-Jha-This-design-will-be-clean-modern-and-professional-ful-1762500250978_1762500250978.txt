🎨 Professional Portfolio Concept: Neha Jha
This design will be clean, modern, and professional, fulfilling all your specified requirements.

1. Core Design & Style
Theme: Light & Professional

Background: Primarily White (#FFFFFF) or a very light off-white/grey (#F9F9F9).

Accent Color: Choose a single, strong color for professionalism. Examples: Navy Blue (#0A2A43), Deep Teal (#008080), or Rich Burgundy (#800020). This color will be used for buttons, links, and key headings.

Text Color: Dark Grey (#333333) or Black for easy readability.

Typography: Classic & Readable

You've chosen Times New Roman, which is a classic serif font. This is great, but to keep it modern, we'll pair it with another font.

Headings (H1, H2, H3): Times New Roman (This will convey authority and a professional look).

Body Text (Paragraphs): A clean sans-serif font like 'Lato', 'Roboto', 'Open Sans', or 'Montserrat'.

Why? Times New Roman for headings adds style, while a sans-serif font for the body makes long paragraphs much easier to read on a screen.

Style: Smart & Animated

"Smart" means a clear grid layout, lots of whitespace (empty space), and easy navigation.

"Animation" will be kept subtle and professional (no excessive bouncing).

Page Load: A gentle 'fade-in' effect.

On Scroll: As the user scrolls down, sections gently 'fade-in' or 'slide-up'.

Buttons/Links: A subtle color change or slight shadow effect on mouse hover.
